# **About Me**
Hi, I am Diego Villalpando :wave:,<br>

I am a Java back-end developer, and a Pentaho Data Integration Implementation Specialist.<br>

I have extensive experience with git, databases such as PostgreSQL and Oracle. Cloud environments such as AWS and GCP. Agile methodologies such as Hypothesis Driven Development, Personas, User Stories, MVP, prototyping. And programming languages such as SQL, JS, TS, Batch, and Bash.<br>

On a more personal side, I am an horticulture hobbyist. I love to go hiking, swimming, stargazing, and cooking. I honor and promote diversity in all it forms.<br>
