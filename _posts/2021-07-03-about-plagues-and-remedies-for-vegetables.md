description: My findings about common pests & their remedies for urban horticulture gardens.

I've some experience with pests in my garden, the most common have been white flies, mildew, and snails. Luckily I have tested some solutions on several plants and found some that work, and others that failed (some even killed plants). I'll continue to update this page as I find out more solutions to horticulure pests.

If you have  a solution to repel snails please let me know!
